- Guest pass application is initially designed and used to record the customer information visiting a store during pandemic and notifies all customers if any outbreak is reported. It is later customized to reserve services for the given number of customers.
- Store Queue is a virtual queueing system that helps customers to wait in the queue virtually when the stores were allowed to have limited customers at a time. It updates the customers when there is a change in the queue, so customers can skip the physical queue outside the store irrespective of the Canadian climatic conditions.
- Curbside pickup application was initially designed for restaurants, later it was extended to all businesses that can deliver their services through curbside upon request.

### Blood Flow Quantification using Time of Flight: 
`Language used: Haskell`
As my academic project, I have worked on Hashed Expressions which is a part of COCONUT library used in IBM for compiler development. This library is used for symbolic computation and for continuous optimization for instruction scheduling. Here Optimization/ simplification is done at a high(math) level by eliminating common subexpressions and it uses declarative expressions with single static assignment. 


### HashedToLLVM: 
`Language and library used: Haskell, llvm-hs`
As an extension of the above project, I worked on code generation in C and LLVM for the given instruction in Haskell. The above project works majorly on the parser end of the compiler library. The initial phase is code generation for the given Haskell expression to C using String concatenation. In order to provide high level efficiency, code generation is done in LLVM. LLVM is the intermediate representation of any high level programming language and it offers various features like cross platform compatibility and multiple levels of optimizations. 


## OTHER PROJECTS
**NewYouthHack, PAL**:   
`Language used: Elm, Haskell`
- Developed a web app for youth immigrants in Canada with BMC for IRCC. 
 
**National Design League Website**:
`Tool used: Adobe XD.`
- Designed a Website for National Design League at Designathon event at McMaster University. 

**Automation of SQL server integration with Google sheets**:
- I worked on this project as a Freelancer for the company "Dataception Business Intelligence C.O. Limited". It is an automation project which is developed using Python script.

**Jucoholic Website**:
- Designed a Website for a Eco-friendly bag manufacturing company called Jucoholic using an online tool called WIX.

**Automatic Construction of Ontology for the Web**:
- Created a methodology to extract information from the web to build ontology for a given domain
